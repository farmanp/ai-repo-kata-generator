    Examine the `_basic_yaml_load` function and use it to parse a small YAML string.
    What Python data structure does it return for the following input?

    ```yaml
    foo:
      - bar: 1
      - baz:
          - qux
    ```
  hint: "Track how `stack`, `indents`, and `key_stack` interact as indentation changes"
  expected_output: "{'foo': [{'bar': 1}, {'baz': ['qux']}]}"
  reflection_question: "How does the parser know when to switch from dictionaries to lists?"
